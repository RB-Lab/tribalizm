# Link to tribe

User finds a link in.. whatever, Twitter. User clicks that link and get's to the tribe page

-   If user is in that tribe they just see the page
-   If they are already in Tribalizm they see the page with "apply" button,
    -   apply
    -   send message to elder
-   If they're not in Tribalizm yet, they see the page with "apply" and "what is Tribalizm" buttons,
    -   apply,
    -   enter your location
    -   write cover letter
-   If there is incarnated in local area tribe user goes straight there, if not â€“ it gets to astral tribe

When user create a tribe they get the tribe page with the link to "astral" tribe.
Later this link can be obtained in user's tribe's list in "profile"

### Problem

There are several types of tribe view:

-   List in "List tribes": title, truncated description, members count, `apply`, `more`
-   List in "my tribes": `title` (in button)
-   "Page" in landing. Pic, title, description, `apply`, `what is Tribalizm`
-   "Page" in profile. Pic, title, description, `edit`? `back`
-   "Page" in "List tribes". Pic, title, description, incarnations? `apply` `back`

The problem here is that when apply, to remove keyboard we need to either edit text or caption.
In both cases we also have to re-create markup.
